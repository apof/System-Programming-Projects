System Programming Projects of DI course

-->Proj1: CDR (Call detail Record) data warehouse based on hashing and pointer based binary heap data structures.

-->Proj2: Job Management System (Jms) for multi-job submission and execution. The System is based on
client server concept has been implemented a 3-level process hierarchy for the multi-task management. Named pipes,
low level I/O, Signals, and Bash Scripting have been utilized for the implementation of the System, for Job coordination and
for Statistic Reporting of the whole Process.

-->Proj3: Implementing a selective overhead mirroring system. The goal of the system is to copy multiple files and directories
to a remote device. Multiple Client server model has been implemented and many different types of processes such as workers,managers have been designed for this goal. POSIX threads and sockets have been selected for parallelism and inter-network communication.
